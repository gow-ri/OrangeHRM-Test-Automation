# OrangeHRM-Test-Automation

I undertook a personal QA project to test OrangeHRM, a popular HR management software, to gain practical experience in software testing and to develop skills that are valuable for a career in quality assurance. 

- Developed a Selenium WebDriver script in Java to automate the login process.
- Executed the script across different browsers to ensure compatibility.
- Enhanced understanding of test automation principles and frameworks.
